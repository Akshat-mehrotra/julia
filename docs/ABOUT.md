Julia is an open-source high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language designed for technical and scientific computing while also being effective for general-purpose tasks. It is convenient to use for daily work but also runs fast enough to be deployed for high-performance applications.

Interesting features include:
- Large parts of [Julia's base library](https://github.com/julialang/julia) are written in Julia itself. Understanding and contributing to the Julia core does not require knowledge of another language.
- Easy to use interfaces to call libraries written in other languages, such as [C, Fortran](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/) and [Python](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl), directly.
- [Multiple dispatch](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/methods/#man-methods)
- A dynamic, nominative and parametric [type system](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/types/).
- Homoiconicity: Julia code can be represented in Julia itself, making it a good language to learn about [metaprogramming](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/).

The first public release was in 2012. You can find out more about the motivation behind it in the blog post ["Why We Created Julia"](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia) by the core developers.

Despite its young age, Julia is already being used in the real world in a variety of fields, such as but not limited to Finance, Data Science and Scientific Computing. You can find many showcase applications on [juliabloggers.com](http://www.juliabloggers.com/) and a list of publications about the language and its technical computing applications [here](http://julialang.org/publications/).
