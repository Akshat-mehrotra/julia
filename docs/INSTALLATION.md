To install Julia on your system follow the instructions on the [Julia Language Downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

For a local installation, it is recommended to use [Juno](http://junolab.org/). It's an IDE based on Atom and offers a powerful text editor as well as additional features for developing in Julia. Just follow the instructions on their website.

A simple way to get started with Julia without the need of a local installation is [JuliaBox](http://junolab.org/), which is an online IDE based on Jupyter notebooks. You just access it from your browser, login and you can start solving exercises.

### Sidenotes

While not necessary for the exercism exercises, you will likely run across Julia packages that require a python installation. JuliaBox already comes with one by default. If you use a local installation, check out the [Conda.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl) package, which provides an easy way to install Python dependencies. Alternatively, [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) offers a Python distribution that already ships with many of the most popular scientific Python libraries.
