To install Julia on your system follow the instructions on the [Julia Language Downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

[JuliaPro](http://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) includes the latest stable version of Julia, the Juno IDE, a debugger, a Jupyter notebook environment and many of the most popular Julia packages. It is a convenient way to install everything you will need to get started. Please note that JuliaPro may contain outdated versions of packages or the language itself as it focuses on providing a stable installation.

For a local installation, there are multiple IDEs/editor plugins available. The most popular ones are [Juno](http://junolab.org/) and the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode). Just follow the instructions on their websites.

A simple way to get started with Julia without the need of a local installation is [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/), which is an online IDE based on Jupyter notebooks. You just access it from your browser, login and you can start solving exercises.
