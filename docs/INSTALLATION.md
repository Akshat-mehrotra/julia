To install Julia on your system follow the instructions on the [Julia Language Downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

[JuliaPro](http://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) includes the latest stable version of Julia, the Juno IDE, a debugger, a Jupyter notebook environment and many of the most popular Julia packages. It is a convenient way to install everything you will need to get started.

For a local installation, it is recommended to use [Juno](http://junolab.org/). It's an IDE based on Atom and offers a powerful text editor as well as additional features for developing in Julia. Just follow the instructions on their website.

A simple way to get started with Julia without the need of a local installation is [JuliaBox](http://junolab.org/), which is an online IDE based on Jupyter notebooks. You just access it from your browser, login and you can start solving exercises.
