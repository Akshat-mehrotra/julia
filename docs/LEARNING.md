# Learning Julia From Scratch

Exercism assumes that you already have some knowledge about the Julia language to the point where you understand the basic concept of a function and know the syntax reasonably well. The Julia language website contains a regularly updated [list of learning resources](https://julialang.org/learning/). This is the go-to place when looking for books and tutorials on Julia.

For examples on what to do with Julia as well as more specific tutorials, check out [juliabloggers.com](https://www.juliabloggers.com/).

Please note: Julia is a rather young and still rapidly evolving language and as such, examples from books or tutorials written for older versions of Julia may not work anymore without (small) adjustments.
